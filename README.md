This is the [FreedomSponsors](http://www.freedomsponsors.org) "SponsorThis"
plugin for [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/).

When installed, it will add a nice, discrete "Sponsor this" link on your
Bugzilla's bug pages, just below the "Importance" bit.

The link leads to a FreedomSponsors page where the user can place a bounty for
that bug.

Similar functionality is also available for Jira (see the [Jira plugin](https://github.com/freedomsponsors/freedomsponsors-jira-plugin)) and the Github issue tracker ([learn more](http://blog.freedomsponsors.org/freedomsponsors-github-integration/))

and extract the package's contents into the "extensions" subdirectory of your
